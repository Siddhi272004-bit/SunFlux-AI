# SunFlux-AI
HelioSynapse is a PyTorch-based deep learning project for predicting solar flare activity from solar imagery. Motivated by the role of solar flares in triggering geomagnetic disturbances (GMDs) affecting power grids and satellites, the project focuses on OpenCV-based preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, with scope for future scaling.
